<h1>Swiss-Tournament-App</h1>

This is a small project for me to learn (train) Kotlin / Jetpack-Compose. 

<p>
  A small android-app for creating chess-tournaments with the swiss-system. 
  It uses JaVaFo to do the pairing and TRFx-files under the hood to store results of every round.
  The app runs locally and does not need a connection to the internet.

<h2>Releases and Installation</h2>
<p>
  Find the latest .apk file under "releases". 
  For installation either use adb + PC or Download the apk directly on your Phone. There is a developer setting which allows .apks from non Google-Playstore sources.
</p>

A more enthusiastic README.md may be release to a later point in time ...
